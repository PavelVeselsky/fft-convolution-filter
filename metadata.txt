about=Smoothing and edge detection based on fftconvolve() SciPy function, as included in the gaussian_blur() function by Mike Toews (http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/10467). The edge detection is implemented by subtracting the smoothed raster from the original one. NumPy, SciPy and Rasterio python modules are needed.
